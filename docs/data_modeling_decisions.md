## ADR-001: EMAIL_MASK is role-based, not a blanket restriction

**Status:** Accepted (2026-09-08); amended 2026-09-09 to move governance objects into a dedicated `GOVERNANCE` database.
**Phase:** Defined in Phase 2 (this PR — Terraform PII tagging/masking infra); attached to a gold-model column in Phase 6.

### Context

`terraform/masking_policies.tf` defines `EMAIL_MASK`, a Snowflake masking policy, and `terraform/tags.tf` defines the paired `PII` tag. Neither Phase 2 (infra) nor any phase before it produces a table with an email column — the future consumer is `dim_customer_360.contact_email` (naming per the ERP/CRM `contact_email`/`customer_email` fields documented in `docs/synthetic_data_spec.md`), which doesn't exist until the Phase 6 gold models are built. The policy and tag are written now so the pattern is established and reviewable before there's a real column to attach it to, rather than being designed under time pressure once Phase 6 lands.

The two options considered for the policy body:

1. **Blanket restriction** — mask the column for every querying role, with no exception.
2. **Role-based** — unmask for the role that legitimately needs the real value, mask for everyone else.

### Decision

`EMAIL_MASK` is role-based: `CURRENT_ROLE()` in `('TRANSFORMER_ROLE')` returns the real value; every other role, including `READ_ONLY_ANALYST`, gets a fixed placeholder (`'***MASKED***'`).

### Ownership: `GOVERNANCE.SECURITY`, not `PROD_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC`

`EMAIL_MASK` and `PII` were originally defined in `PROD_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC`. That was wrong: `PROD_ANALYTICS` is one peer among `DEV_ANALYTICS`/`STAGE_ANALYTICS`/`PROD_ANALYTICS`, and the tag/policy are meant to be referenced by fully-qualified name from *all three* (see `terraform/tags.tf`'s comment on why tags are routinely cross-database-referenced). Owning shared vocabulary inside one peer environment means DEV and STAGE columns would depend on an object that lives in, and is lifecycled with, PROD — the wrong dependency direction, and one that would force PROD's database to exist and stay stable before DEV could even reference the tag.

Both objects now live in a new `GOVERNANCE` database (`terraform/databases.tf`), in a dedicated `GOVERNANCE.SECURITY` schema rather than `GOVERNANCE.PUBLIC` — `SECURITY` scopes the schema to exactly this kind of object (PII tags, masking policies) so a future unrelated governance object doesn't get dumped into the same namespace by default. **`GOVERNANCE.SECURITY` is the one fully-qualified name used everywhere** a tag or policy is defined or attached — Terraform, this ADR, and the Phase 6 `ALTER TABLE` example below all use it; there is no other name for these objects anywhere in the codebase.

`TRANSFORMER_ROLE` has `USAGE` on `GOVERNANCE` (database) and `GOVERNANCE.SECURITY` (schema) — see `terraform/roles.tf`. That grant makes the tag and policy visible/referenceable by fully-qualified name; it is **not** sufficient to attach either to a column. Attaching requires the separate `APPLY TAG` and `APPLY MASKING POLICY` privileges, which this PR deliberately does **not** grant — there's no real column to attach to yet, and granting an attachment privilege with nothing to exercise it against is premature. That grant is deferred to Phase 6, alongside the `ALTER TABLE` statements themselves. `READ_ONLY_ANALYST` gets no `GOVERNANCE` grant at all, in either phase: masking is enforced at query time against the mart table the policy is attached to, not by the querying role reading the policy object.

A blanket restriction was rejected because `TRANSFORMER_ROLE` (see `terraform/roles.tf`) is the identity dbt itself runs as. Identity resolution — matching CRM `contact_email` against ERP `customer_email`/`contact_email` via the shared identity pool (`docs/synthetic_data_spec.md`, "Why ERP↔CRM join is deterministic") — is a join *on* the real email value. If dbt's own role saw a masked placeholder, every row would collapse to the same masked string and the join would match everything to everything. A masking policy has no notion of "the pipeline that's currently building the table" separate from "a role querying it" — the warehouse role is the only trust boundary Snowflake gives us, so the exception has to be expressed as a role, not as a build-time/query-time distinction.

### Consequences

- dbt transform runs (as `TRANSFORMER_ROLE`) operate on real email values end-to-end, so identity resolution keeps working once it's built in Phase 5.
- `READ_ONLY_ANALYST` — and any future role — never sees a real email address by default; a new role only gains visibility by being added to the `CURRENT_ROLE()` allow-list in the policy body, which is a reviewable one-line Terraform diff, not a per-table grant that's easy to miss.
- The trust boundary is enforced at the role Snowflake already authenticates the session against, not by trusting the application/BI layer to filter columns correctly.
- If a future role needs the real value (e.g. a support/ops role handling GDPR data-subject requests), it's added to the same allow-list rather than the policy being redesigned.

### Note on attachment timing

`EMAIL_MASK` and the `PII` tag are defined in this PR but **not attached to any table or column** — none exists yet, and the `APPLY TAG`/`APPLY MASKING POLICY` privileges needed to attach them have deliberately not been granted to `TRANSFORMER_ROLE` either (see "Ownership" above — the `USAGE` grant this PR does add only makes the objects referenceable, it does not authorize attachment). Both the grants and the attachment itself land together in Phase 6, once a gold model materializes the email column, via:

```sql
ALTER TABLE PROD_ANALYTICS.<schema>.DIM_CUSTOMER_360
  MODIFY COLUMN CONTACT_EMAIL
  SET MASKING POLICY GOVERNANCE.SECURITY.EMAIL_MASK;

ALTER TABLE PROD_ANALYTICS.<schema>.DIM_CUSTOMER_360
  MODIFY COLUMN CONTACT_EMAIL
  SET TAG GOVERNANCE.SECURITY.PII = 'EMAIL';
```

That `ALTER TABLE` is expected to be added to the Phase 6 dbt model (a post-hook or a `snowflake__copy_grants`-style migration) rather than run by hand, so the attachment survives a full `dbt build` from a clean database.
